 ## The Tangent Problem

 The tangent problem is to find the equation of the line that is tangent to a curve at a point.

 ## The Velocity Problem

 ### Example: Car Driving

 A car accelerates to 60 mph for 2 hours, then slows down to 10 mph for 1 hour, then accelerates to 70 mph for an hour, then decelerates and stops.
